# Shyaka portfolio
## All images were used in the UX course for the prototype were downloaded from google. The same photos were used in the website prototype. None of the photos are my own work.

## I removed the text font that was in the prototype design because i couldn't find it in google fonts and i realised that the bold text works well font so i decided to use it.

## Some changes happened in the Navbar as on the small screen the navbar toggler icon is located at the right corner of the screen and the text at the left.

### QUESTION: Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes.

### ANSWER: The first challenge i faced was applying code on the wrong class. it took some time to fully have a better understanding and as i was doing the assignment, i was getting a better understanding from mistakes and corrections.

### QUESTION: What have you learned by creating your web portfolio? 

### ANSWERS: I can't say that i did the assignment very well but am better than last week. I have learnt that it is a process of some failings, reviewing and adjusting. It take time to fully have a strong understanding but as long as you are willing to put in the time and focus the results will come.
